            <p>1.) Factor 3 from the expression, since both 6 and 12 can be divided by 3, that makes 3 their GCF factor. If we divided 6x by 3, then it would be 2x. If we divide 12 by 3, then it would be 4. Hence, the top is 3 ( 2x + 4) because when you distribute them, it will turn back again to 6x + 12</p>

            <p>1.) Identify which is a, b, and c</p>

            <p>a = <u>1</u> → <i>It’s 1 because if there’s no coefficient in a variable (x), it’s automatically 1</i></p>
            <p>b = <u>- 5</u></p>
            <p>c = <u>6</u></p>

            <hr>

            <p>2.) Substitute the values of a, b, and c into the formula</p>

            <p>x = -(-5) ± √(-5)² - 4(1)(6) / 2(1)</p>

            <hr>

            <p>3.) Simplify on what’s in the square root</p>

            <p>(-5)² → <u>25</u></p>
            <p>4 (1) (6) → <u>24</u></p>

            <p>x = -(-5) ± √25 - 24 / 2(1)</p>
            <p>x = -(-5) ± √1 / 2(1)</p>

            <hr>

            <p>4.) Distribute the negative sign to -5, multiply 2 by 1 from the bottom, and square root 1</p>

            <p>x = -(-5) ± √1 / 2</p>
            <p>x = 5 ± 1 / 2</p>

            <hr>

            <p>5.) Solve for x by adding and subtracting</p>

             <p>x = 5 + 1 / 2</p>
             <p>x = 6 / 2</p>
             <b><u><p>x = 3</p></u></b>

             <hr>

           <p> x = 5 - 1 / 2</p>
             <p>x = 4 / 2</p>
             <b><u><p>x = 2</p></u></b>
             
            <b><u><p>FINAL ANSWER:</u> x = 3, 2</p></b>
